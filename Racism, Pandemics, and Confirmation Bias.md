If you google &quot;H1N1 2009 Origin&quot;, or &quot;which country started H1N1?&quot;, the answer would quickly pop up in an enlarged text box presented by the search engine with bold letters saying **Mexico**. Beneath the answer block, there is another list of questions with the portion named &quot;People Also Ask&quot;. If you click on the first question, &quot;Which country started H1N1?&quot;, the answer would pop up as &quot;Singapore confirmed its first case of H1N1 in late May 2009&quot;. So, who started the pandemic that claimed 363,550 (mean of [CDC estimate 151,700-575,400](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/spotlights/pandemic-global-estimates.htm)) lives globally and 12,469 (mean of [CDC estimate 8,868-18,306](https://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/estimates_2009_h1n1.htm)) lives in the United States? Which country shall we blame? Singapore or Mexico? In fact, neither. CDC explicitly points out that the 2009 H1N1 virus was &quot;[first detected in people in the United States](https://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/information_h1n1_virus_qa.htm#a)&quot;. Knowing the fact, it is interesting to question how Mexico and Singapore became the scapegoat of the origin of the infection. While conspiracy theorists may suggest that Google is behind this and manipulated the result, it is more rational to look at how the suggested answer functionality and &quot;People Also Ask&quot; block work on Google. The algorithm behind the promoted questions and answers is that the more people click on a link when searching a question, the more likely it is presented as a suggested answer when other people search similar questions. The algorithm also takes in account where the user is located and present the most popular answer in the region. Here we come to a terrifying conclusion. Mexico and Singapore were used as the scapegoat because people in the United States want to believe that they are responsible for the pandemic. This bias caused the search engine to misidentify the answer to the question and further mislead other people, thus reinforcing the misconception. The bias has a name in psychology, it is called confirmation bias, which is &quot;[the tendency to gather evidence that confirms preexisting expectations](https://dictionary.apa.org/confirmation-bias)&quot;. The search engine incident is not the only time foreign country or non-white race is tied to a pandemic and blamed for the spread of a disease. In fact, disease fuels racism through confirmation bias. The current coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic in China and how it is perceived in the United States is a perfect example to illustrate this.

The coronavirus outbreak attracts many attacks from US media towards China and Chinese Americans. On February 3rd, about a month after the outbreak, Walter Russell Mead published an opinion piece on the Wall Street Journal. The content of the article largely focuses on how the pandemic is going to affect China&#39;s economy in the first quarter. The tone of the article is also quite neutral. Nothing looks wrong until you look at the title of the opinion piece, &quot;[_China Is the Real Sick Man of Asia_](https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-is-the-real-sick-man-of-asia-11580773677#comments_sector)_&quot;._ The wording might not stand out to the Americans, as it also happens to be a common analogy used in the field of history, but the analogy &quot;sick man of Asia&quot; was first associated to China during WWII. It was used by the Japanese as an ethnically charged word to insult Chinese and Chinese descents. On a scale from 1 to 10, if saying the n-word is a level 10 racial insult, referring China as the Sick Man of Asia would be 8. Initially many who read the opinion piece assumed that the Author Mr. Mead is the one who came up with the title. In an email Mr. Mead sent out for clarification, however, did point out that he did not know the title until the piece is published and the title is picked by a Wall Street Journal editor. Just when you thought that this racist title is the result of a careless editor, and the damage can be controlled by changing the title of the opinion piece, the Editorial Board of Wall Street Journal published another opinion piece, &quot;[_Banished in Beijing_](https://www.wsj.com/articles/banished-in-beijing-11582157934#comments_sector)&quot;, in response to the outrage caused by the title. The piece used several arguments to create a seemingly persuasive article, but if we look closely, there is no solid ground beneath the arguments. First, the author builds a convincing point that &quot;Most Americansâ€¦understand the phrase in the context of the dying Ottoman Empire as &#39;the sick man of Europe.&#39; That was our historical analogy.&quot; Here the author uses confirmation bias to convince his American readers that the wording is as innocent as how it is used on the Ottoman Empire, which preexists in many readers&#39; knowledge. The argument is flawed due to obvious reason. Racism is all about context, the same words can be used to describe one race of people with no consequences, but when applied to a specific race, the words can also be the worst racist insult. Furthermore, the editorial board tries to defend its stand by giving the example that &quot;In 2011 Foreign Affairs used the headline &#39;The Sick Man of Asia: China&#39;s Health Crisis&#39; over an article by Yanzhong Huang, a professor who grew up in China and graduated from Fudan University&quot;. The editorial board stresses on how the author of the article is an original Chinese and tries to make the point that Chinese articles are also using the word, making it fine for WSJ to use similar wording. This argument is almost laughable. This is the equivalent of a white man saying that it is fine for him to say the n-word because he heard black people saying it. Near the end of the article, the editorial board also belittles those who spoke out against the racist title as puppets brainwashed by the Chinese government, &quot;If you think this was spontaneous outrage, you don&#39;t understand how China&#39;s government works to influence public opinion at home and abroad. Beijing knows how to exploit America&#39;s identity politics to charge &#39;racism&#39; in service of its censorship.&quot; As an Asian American and a international student myself, I can prove that this is not what was happening. After learning about the racist title upon the article&#39;s publication, many of my international students&#39; friends and Chinese American friends spoke out spontaneously on social media platforms against the racism. In support of its argument that the outrage is orchestrated by the Chinese government, the editorial board gave the example of an article published by Xinhua, &quot;[_Racism worse enemy than epidemic_](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-02/07/c_138764381.htm)&quot;, which denounces Wall Street Journal for its racist headline. The fatal flaw of WSJ&#39;S argument is, though the English version of the Xinhua article is published on February 7th, the [mandarin version of the article](http://www.xinhuanet.com/2020-02/24/c_1125619151.htm) was published on February 24th, five days later than the Wall Street Journal&#39;s editorial board opinion piece that made the accusation, which was published on the [19th](https://www.wsj.com/articles/banished-in-beijing-11582157934#comments_sector). Since when did Chinese government orchestrate a movement by publishing English only articles? The editorial board only thinks that this argument would work because there are preexisting knowledge in Americans&#39; mind that Communist governments are very good at brainwashing and propaganda. The confirmation bias is based on outdated knowledge of Soviet Union and China in Cold War period and related writings like _Animal Farm_ and _1984,_ and thus a flawed source of learning what China really is today.

Furthermore, there is something terrifying hidden in the Wall Street Journal&#39;s accusation that the Chinese government brainwashed people to show outrage against the newspaper. It is that whenever Chinese Americans or Chinese nationals in the United States voice out their spontaneous opinions, white Americans can always attack the movement by saying that the movement is orchestrated and brainwashed by the Chinese government. The underlying implication is that the freewill of the Chinese Americans and Chinese nationals cannot be trusted as if our ethnicity is especially vulnerable to brainwash and propagandas. This implication reveals the real racism many Chinese American and Chinese nationals faces in the U.S on a daily basis. Whenever we want to have a logical debate with one of our fellow Americans in regard of China today, if our argument aligns with the Chinese government on no matter how tiny the subject is, our fellow American would likely to think that we are brainwashed by the government thus not taking our logical points seriously and win the argument by simply repeating words like propaganda, brainwash, and censorship. Similar to how Nazis demonized the Jews, the US media is demonizing the Chinese government and the word brainwash is such a good excuse for not listening carefully to the other side of the story.
